#
# This virtual unit maps the default core components and their dependencies.
#
# The real desktop services should go into the final desktop target
# folder, which should require this virtual target. While starting
# up, systemd will assure that the core EFL and daemons start before
# anything else. After the core target finishes, dependencies should
# not matter too much anymore and less fine-grained dependencies can
# be used.
